      <h1>The Day I wrote my First Story</h1>
      <main>
          <p>So I was working as a full-time Programmer Analyst in a multinational company, and suddenly one of my friends asked me if I could write a short story for her company's essay competition. Well, I had never written a story previously(apart from the ones when we had to write in school), so I thought I would not be able to do a good job. Since my friend requested me, I thought, hmm, maybe, I should give it a try atleast. Anyway, its not going to be selected, so why not just write something meaningful.</p><p>I wrote this story and I remember writing it in less than an hour and I just gave it to my friend. She thanked me and guess what happened the other day! The story that I wrote was selected by the judges and my friend called up and told me she had received a prize for it. I was so happy for her, eventually my friend ended up giving the prize to me. Anyway, the whole experience was quite overwhelming and now I have so many of my friends asking to write short stories. Haha.</p><p>Thanks for reading this piece!</p>
